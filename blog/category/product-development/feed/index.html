				<description><![CDATA[For typical keyfob driven by SAW resonator, the high quality usually means optimised for best frequency stability, fast startup time and ghost-less working, which will greatly affect actual working distance. The first point, best frequency stability, is achieved when local LC network&#8217;s actual working frequency is a little more than desired frequency, and drifts SAW ...]]></description>
